02 Advanced CSS:Portfolio

Built a portfolio page for Amanda Franklin 2023
Created a nav bar that includes links to 3 projects.

Created Header using my name along with the year. Using text align and text-shadow, I was able to get the visual appeal that I was looking for.

I then moved on to adding an avatar within the page. img src along with the size were entered and then the image was centered on the page.

The bio was added soon after using header commands. the style.css shows how i was able to syle and center the text to make it align with the page.

Next links to my actual projects were added. Although I have yet to make full projects in this program, I plan to implement them and replace the current Project links
with my actual projects
The images are also set up to open the corresponding project.
